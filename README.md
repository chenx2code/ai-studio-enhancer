## üí° How to Use

### :exclamation: Important Prerequisite: Enable Autosave

**Please note:** To ensure this extension works correctly, you **must** enable the **"Autosave"** feature in your Google AI Studio settings. (This extension relies on the internal data updates triggered by AI Studio's autosave to capture the most complete conversation history. If autosave is not enabled, the extension will not be able to retrieve real-time conversation content, leading to functionality failure or incomplete content.)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

*   **Dependency on Google AI Studio Page Structure and API:** This extension is highly dependent on the current HTML structure, CSS class names, and internal network request response data structures of the Google AI Studio website. If Google undertakes major website redesigns in the future, it may cause selectors or data parsing logic to fail, making the extension unable to work properly. Code updates would be required at that time.
