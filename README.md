# Google AI Studio Markdown Copier Chrome Extension

 [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

This is a Chrome extension designed to simplify the process of exporting conversation content from Google AI Studio.

It adds a prominent **"Copy conversation as Markdown"** button to the toolbar on the AI Studio conversation page. After clicking the button, the extension automatically captures the complete history of the current conversation, formats it into clean, structured **Markdown**, and copies it directly to the user's clipboard.

This is very convenient for users who need to use the conversation content for:

*   Saving and archiving important conversation records.
*   Quoting AI responses in technical documents, blog posts, or notes.
*   Sharing the complete interaction process with others.
*   Importing conversations into other tools for analysis or processing.

## :exclamation: Important Prerequisite: Enable Autosave

**Please note:** To ensure this extension works correctly, you **must** enable the **"Autosave"** feature in your Google AI Studio settings.

This extension relies on the internal data updates triggered by AI Studio's autosave to capture the most complete conversation history. If autosave is not enabled, the extension will not be able to retrieve real-time conversation content, leading to failed or incomplete copies.

## ‚ú® Main Features

*   **One-Click Copy:** Adds an easy-to-use "Copy conversation as Markdown" button to the Google AI Studio conversation page toolbar.
*   **Structured Markdown:** Automatically converts the conversation into standard Markdown format:
    *   The conversation title becomes a level-1 heading (`#`).
    *   Each user prompt becomes a level-2 heading (`##`).
    *   The model's thought process and final answer are included as body text, preserving the original Markdown formatting.
    *   A `---` separator is used to distinguish between different conversation turns.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

*   **Dependency on Google AI Studio's Structure and API:** This extension is highly dependent on the current HTML structure, CSS class names, and internal network request response data structures of the Google AI Studio website. If Google undertakes a major site redesign in the future, it could break the selectors or data parsing logic, causing the extension to fail. This would require a code update.
